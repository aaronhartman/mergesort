Synopsis: Implementation of Mergesort algorithm in Javascript/HTML that takes an input text file of line separated values, sorts them and displays the results. For a sample input file see the 100karray.txt in this repo.

Also solves the classic "count the inversions" problem using divide and conquer.

To try it out, first you will need to have an input file on your local machine. You can create your own line separated text input file, or use https://github.com/aaronhartman/mergesort/blob/master/100kIntegers.txt

Once you have an input file on your machine, go to: https://aaronhartman.github.io/mergesort/
